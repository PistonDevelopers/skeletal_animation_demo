Rigged mesh was generated with [MakeHuman](http://www.makehuman.org/).
Animations were adapted from motion capture sequences from [CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/)
which were converted to a BVH format [here](https://sites.google.com/a/cgspeed.com/cgspeed/motion-capture/cmu-bvh-conversion) and loaded 
into [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) and retargeted for the MakeHuman rig using [MakeWalk](http://www.makehuman.org/doc/node/mhblendertools_makewalk_basic_workflow.html).
